    "content": "<p>They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And while your stomach may not agree, its at least advisable to have something before you start a long hard work day. You can arguably make it more pleasant by creating a little area in your kitchen or living room, where you can read your morning news, check email, or simply watch as your neighborhood awakens and prepares for the day ahead. Some of these breakfast nook ideas can dispose even the most earnest owls to at least crack a smile at their sight.</p> <h4>Bright Breakfast Nook Ideas</h4> <p>Bright colors are energizing. And if you dont drink coffee, you might need something else to perk you up after (hopefully) hours of sleep. There are many ways you can use brights to both take advantage of that quality but also lessen their characteristic eye-watering effect. A bold bright settee or bench is a great way to focus all attention on the area, while a few bright throw pillows make for eye-catchy accents.</p> <h4>Minimal Breakfast Nook Designs</h4> <p>Not a fan of loud sounds or colors in the morning? We hear ya. Minimalism does well not only in terms of style but also creates a calm atmosphere, where you can come to your senses at the pace, youre most comfortable with. Milky greys, browns, and grey-ish blues are perfect hues for setting a mild tone to your breakfast area.</p>",
