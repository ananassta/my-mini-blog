    "content": "<p>The rivalry between cats and dogs is one thats known around the world. Its depicted time after time in cartoons and films and youve probably heard of the saying they fight like cats and dogs. Many believe that the two species cant get along and that its just a simple case of them being too different from one another, as dogs are exuberant and full of energy, while cats are solitary creatures that prefer peace and quiet. But whats the actual reason behind the clash and most importantly, can they ever get along? Keep reading to find out about the possibility of cat and dog friends and discover the reasoning behind why their personalities usually clash.</p> <h4>Mixed messages</h4> <p>Where its sometimes the case of opposites attract, this doesnt seem to be the case with cats and dogs. The main thing getting in the way of a harmonious friendship is that cat and dog body language often means different things.</p> <p>With a dog a high tail and head means that theyre challenging the other individual, while in cats this is often a signal that they want to be friends. A wagging tail also means the opposite thing in the two species, as the swishing back and forth of a tail can indicate a happy and excitable dog, but a very angry cat.</p> <p>Because their body language is so different, they often misinterpret each other which results in plenty of scratched noses and frightened and confused cats and dogs. However, this doesnt mean that theyre incompatible by nature, they just need careful introductions in an environment where they can get used to each others differences. So, how do help make your cat and dog become friends with each other?</p> <h4>First impressions are vital</h4> <p>The trick to making your cat and dog friends is to start with the right introductions. Cats are quite unforgiving in their nature and are less likely to be open to the situation if it goes badly, so its very important that the first encounter goes well. Take your time with the introductions and let them sniff each other before meeting face-to-face by using their bedding or something else that they frequently use. This will allow them to familiarise themselves and get used to each other a little at a time, and will make the first meeting less stressful for both of them.</p> <h4>Its easier when theyre young</h4> <p>Cats and dogs are much more likely to become lifelong friends if they meet each other from the very start, as theyll be able to grow up together and learn how the other wants them to behave as theyre still discovering the world around them. When theyre young theyre more likely to be open to a friendship as territorial behaviours and the traditional fear instincts have not yet been given time to manifest.</p>",
