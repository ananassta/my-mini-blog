    "content": "<h4>Does a healthy lifestyle make a difference?</h4> <p>As it turns out, healthy habits make a big difference. According to this analysis, people who met criteria for all five habits enjoyed significantly, impressively longer lives than those who had none: 14 years for women and 12 years for men (if they had these habits at age 50). People who had none of these habits were far more likely to die prematurely from cancer or cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>Study investigators also calculated life expectancy by how many of these five healthy habits people had. Just one healthy habit (and it didnt matter which one) … just one… extended life expectancy by two years in men and women. Not surprisingly, the more healthy habits people had, the longer their lifespan. This is one of those situations where I wish I could reprint their graphs for you, because theyre so cool. (But if youre very curious, the article is available online, and the graphs are on page 7. Check out Graph B, 'Estimated life expectancy at age 50 according to the number of low-risk factors.')</p> <p>This is huge. And, it confirms prior similar research — a lot of prior similar research. A 2017 study using data from the Health and Retirement Study found that people 50 and older who were normal weight, had never smoked, and drank alcohol in moderation lived on average seven years longer. A 2012 mega-analysis of 15 international studies that included over 500,000 participants found that over half of premature deaths were due to unhealthy lifestyle factors such as poor diet, inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol intake, and smoking. And the list of supporting research goes on.</p>",
